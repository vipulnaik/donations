  /* brief_history */ 'Tallinn is a co-founder of Skype and Kazaa and one of the earlier wealthy supporters of organizations working in AI safety, along with Peter Thiel. In 2011, he had a conversation with Holden Karnofsky sharing his thoughts on AI safetyand in particular the work of the Singularity Institute (SI), the former name of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. See https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/givewell/conversations/topics/287 and https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6SGqkCgHuNr7d4yJm/thoughts-on-the-singularity-institute-si for details. Tallinn played a significant role in financing the Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI)''s grantmaking operations, and later funding the Survival and Flourising Fund (SFF). In 2020, Tallinn prepared a philanthropy pledge https://jaan.online/philanthropy.html for his grantmaking for the next five years, and also indicated a plan to switch more to making direct grants using SFF''s S-process, rather than giving funds to organizations such as BERI and SFF.',
  /* brief_donor_focus_notes */ 'https://jaan.online/philanthropy/ says: "the primary purpose of my philanthropy is to reduce existential risks to humanity from advanced technologies, such as AI. i currently believe that this cause scores the highest according to the framework used in effective altruism: (1) importance [...] (2) tractability [...] (3) neglectedness. [...] i''m likely to pass on all other opportunities — especially popular ones, like supporting education, healthcare, arts, and various social causes. [...] i''m considering (as of 2020) a few exceptions — eg, donating to more neglected climate interventions [...] i should also mention that i''m especially fond of software projects as philanthropic targets [...]"',
  /* grant_decision_logistics_notes */ 'Tallinn plans to use the Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF)''s S-process (simulation process) to direct most of his grantmaking, as described e.g. at http://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2019-q4-recommendations and other grant rounds. He may also make one-off direct grants (at most $100,000 per grant) for funding needs that are time-sensitive but encourages grantees to also apply for the next SFF grant round. Tallinn has historically donated money to BERI and SFF for regranting, but does not expect to make similar donations for regranting in the future. Tallinn may also engage in small amounts of individual regranting and individual gifts.',
  /* grant_financing_notes */ 'Tallinn donates his own money, but not always directly; in most cases (particularly when donating to US-based nonprofits) he donates money via (donor-advised funds managed by) Founders Pledge or Silicon Valley Community Foundation. He has also made direct gifts in cryptocurrency when not donating to US nonprofits.',

  /* brief_history */ 'Jeff Kaufman and Julia Wise have been giving since 2003 and have been practicing "earning to give" -- giving about 50% of their annual income -- every year, except years when they were financially tighter because of working at startups or pursuing graduate school. The couple has been highlighted by Peter Singer, and discussed in the mainstream media, for instance https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/books/review/strangers-drowning-by-larissa-macfarquhar.html',
  /* brief_donor_focus_notes */ 'The couple makes sure to donate about half of their donation budget for charities that have a direct impact in global health and development, usually based on GiveWell recommendations. See https://www.jefftk.com/p/2017-donations for the latest affirmation of this; and see https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-global-poverty for more explanation of the focus. The remaining half includes effective altruism/movement growth charities (such as the Centre for Effective Altruism) and more speculative charities.',
  /* grant_decision_logistics_notes */ 'The couple determines their charity budget by computing their adjusted gross income (AGI) with the help of their accountant and then calculating a fixed percentage (usually 50%) of that. See https://www.jefftk.com/p/what-should-income-mean-in-pledging for more details on why the AGI figure is used. They then do a 50-50 or similar split between GiveWell-recommended charities in global health and development, and other areas like effective altruism. The allocations in the GiveWell slice are informed by GiveWell recommendations, the allocations in the other slice are decided based on their own investigation. The actual pacing and modality of payments may depend on personal finances, available payment modalities, and donation matching options. As of late 2017, the couple have started using PayPal Giving Fund where possible because it can use a 2% cash-back credit card without charging either donor or donee any transaction fees, and also does a 1% matching, thus generating an extra 3% altogether. See https://www.jefftk.com/p/paypal-giving-fund and https://www.jefftk.com/p/2017-donations for more.',
  /* grant_financing_notes */ 'The couple generally finances grants from savings, but may in some cases borrow money against future earnings to make donations. The latter is the case in 2017 as https://www.jefftk.com/p/2017-donations explains: "This does mean borrowing some money. Modeling our cash flow I think we will have it paid back in March or April. Much of my current compensation is in stock, and I will not start getting that until I will have been back at Google for a year, which will be this September."',
  /* notes */ 'It looks like the 50% of AGI became a target as a result of a compromise between Jeff and Julia: Jeff sought a little less and Julia sought a little more. In 2017, the couple targeted 30% initially, while Jeff was working at a lower-pay but potentially higher direct-impact job at money transfer company Wave. However, it went back up to 50% after he was fired from Wave and returned to Google. In 2011, the couple did not donate because Jeff was working at a startup and Julia was paying for graduate school out of pocket, see note [1] at https://www.jefftk.com/donations Also, note that donations listed in italics are not included as separate line items in the donations list on the Donations List Website; however, the ones among these that are employer matches are noted as employer matches to the corresponding donation.
