  -- Each chain in full_relationship is of the form:
  --     A (B) ↔ C (D)
  -- Where A and C are individuals and B and D are organizations. The chain
  -- means that a relationship extends between B and D because of the
  -- relationship between A and C. This can happen in one (or more) of the
  -- following ways:
  -- 1. A=C. This means that the same individual is or was part of both
  --    organizations.
  -- 2. B=D. This means that A and C have a relationship by virtue of being
  --    part of the same organization.
  -- 3. A has a relationship with C for some other reason than merely being
  --    part of the same organization (e.g. a friendship).
  -- 4. B and D are organizations that are close for some reason other than a
  --    relationship between individuals, or because there are many
  --    relationships between individuals. For instance, one organization could
  --    be the parent of the other.
