[...] I probably made this mistake because of emotional bias. I was frustrated by people who advocated for global poverty charities for dumb reasons. [...] I thought that if they really had that belief, they should either save their money just in case we found a great intervention for animals in the future, or donate it to the people who were trying to find effective animal right interventions. I think that this latter argument was correct, but I didn''t make it exclusively." (2) "In 2014 and early 2015, I didn''t pay as much attention to OpenPhil as I should have. [...] Being wrong about OpenPhil''s values is forgivable, but what was really dumb is that I didn''t realize how incredibly important it was to my life plan that I understand OpenPhil''s values." (3) "I wish I''d thought seriously about donating to MIRI sooner. [...] Like my error #2, this is an example of failing to realize that when there''s an unknown which is extremely important to my plans but I''m very unsure about it and haven''t really seriously thought about it, I should probably try to learn more about it."');
