The blog post includes three learnings from the experience: (1) the chief must be present at the baraza, (2) targeting criteria (namely, that everybody will receive cash transfers) should be stressed early on in the baraza, (3) it''s important to be flexible in the baraza; for instance, if it looks like people have significant questions or concerns, it may be better to address them first rather than finish the whole 45-minute presentation.

If they find great opportunities that use up or exceed this minimum, then great; if not, any left-over funds of the $3 million minimum will be donated to GiveDirectly. They credit Peter Singer for the idea.');
