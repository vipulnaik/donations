The post clarifies the processes and safeguards the FTX Future Fund has in place for reviewing grants, and explains how FTX is able to manage a large grant volume with a small team: mainly by relying on regranting. The post also clarifies that FTX has not granted much for community-building, so some of the concerns specifically related to community-building grants don''t matter quite yet.'),

He reiterates points made in various blog posts by FTX earlier in the year. He talks about how FTX has tried to scale up giving rapidly. He says he''s happy with how much FTX has been able to do relative to its team size, but that money moved per employee is not the metric to optimize for; what the money achieves is what''s important. He talks about the regranting program and the open call for applications. Later in the talk, he reminisces on his Ph.D. thesis and how his thinking has evolved since then.'),
