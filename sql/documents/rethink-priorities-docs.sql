He also lists key initiatives that Rethink Priorities may take on in 2020. Regarding funding, the post says: "We are heavily funding constrained and have the management capacity and hiring pool to quickly grow if given more money. Our budget for 2020-2021 is between $1,174,000 and $2,384,000 over two years. If funded at the minimum level, we would cover our existing operations through 2021, pay for necessary operational support and buy 10 more hours a week working time from our existing research team."
