Archived Version: May, 2014','2014-05-01',NULL,NULL,'Animal Charity Evaluators',NULL,'Vegan Outreach','Evaluator review of donee','Animal welfare','Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) publishes its first detailed review of Vegan Outreach (VO). Strengths include a long track record of a program that ACE considers cost-effective. Weaknesses include a concern that VO is heavily reliant on anecdotal evidence and is not collecting and therefore not responsive to data suggesting direction changes. Also, the ongoing leadership transition makes it harder for ACE to understand how the organization would be guided going forward'),

The strengths section is mostly the same as in the December 2014 review, but removes a sentence about confidence that the charity can use additional funds well. The weaknesses section is similar to the December 2014 review, but expands more on concerns that VO has been experimenting too much based on poor sources of evidence, and does not have any program with a clear track record');
