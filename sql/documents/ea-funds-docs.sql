The blog post goes over the purpose of EA Funds, structure of fund management teams, the use of the EA Funds platform to directly donate to charities, and the project status and relationship with CEA. Regarding the last point: "Currently EA Funds is a project wholly within the central part of the Centre for Effective Altruism (as opposed to a satellite project housed within the same legal organization, like 80,000 Hours or the Forethought Foundation). However, we’re currently investigating whether this should change. This is largely driven by a divergence in organizational priorities – specifically, that CEA is focusing on building communities and spaces for discussing EA ideas (e.g. local groups, EA Global and related events, and the EA Forum), whereas EA Funds is primarily fundraising-oriented." The post also announces recent updates to the EA Funds website and the launch of a publicly-accessible dashboard for fund statistics https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/about/stats'),

Habryka first lists three reasons he is excited about the Hotel: (a) Providing a safety net, (b) Acting on historical interest, (c) Building high-dedication cultures. He articulates three concrete models of concerns: (1) Initial overeagerness to publicize the EA Hotel (a point he now believes is mostly false, based on Greg Colbourn''s response), (2) Significant chance of the EA Hotel culture becoming actively harmful for residents, (3) No good candidate to take charge of long-term logistics of running the hotel. Habryka concludes by saying he thinks all his concerns can be overcome. At the moment, he thinks the hotel should be funded for the next year, but is unsure of whether they should be given money to buy the hotel next door. The comment replies include one by Greg Colbourn, giving his backstory on the media attention (re: (1)) and discussing the situation with (2) and (3).

He uses the jargon "counterfactually unique" for grant recommendations that, without the Long-Term Future Fund, individual donors nor larger grantmakers like the Open Philanthropy Project would have identified or funded. Based on that measure, he calculates that 20 of 23, or 87%, grant recommendations, worth $673,150 of $923,150, or ~73% of the money to be disbursed, are counterfactually unique. After excluding the grants that people have expressed serious concerns about in the comments, he says: "16 of 23, or 69.5%, of grants, worth $535,150 of $923,150, or ~58%, of the money to be disbursed, are counterfactually unique and fit into a more conservative, risk-averse approach that would have ruled out more uncertain or controversial successful grant applicants." He calls these numbers "an extremely significant improvement in the quality and quantity of unique opportunities for grantmaking the Long-Term Future Fund has made since a year ago." and considers the grants and the grant report an overall success.
