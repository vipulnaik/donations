He writes: "If you either (1) make less than $100k/year, or (2) might be willing to make less than that at some future time in order to work directly on something the world needs you to do (besides giving), I would not be surprised to find myself recommending against you pledging to always donate 10% of your income every year." He talks about his own time spent on setting up the Center for Applied Rationality, and feels that donating money instead of spending resources creating CFAR would have been worse. He writes later: "Expecting variance + respecting your judgement = not pledging"'),

I am somewhat more opposed to attitudes of frugality and self-sacrifice. I wish EA was closer to master morality than slave morality." Further, he writes: "I have a much more negative attitude towards the GWWC pledge than I used to. I think that signing it is a mistake for most young people who signed it. [...] I feel that encouraging the GWWC pledge discourages people from doing direct work or floundering without jobs, both of which are probably more valuable than 10% of a recent grad’s salary. I suspect that more than half of the people I know who signed the GWWC pledge while under 25 now believe that they made that decision badly."

For contrast, he considers direct work in nonprofits and in other high-impact careers. He talks about the value of direct feedback and the significant difference between what a skilled person and a less skilled person can accomplish with direct work. Sinick draws extensively on his experience working at GiveWell where he evaluated the cost-effectiveness of charities');
