Reasons listed include: (1) lower value of cryptocurrency than in 2017, (2) nondisclosed-by-default policy making it harder for potential donors to evaluate research, (3) changes to US tax law in 2018 that may encourage donation bunching, (4) fewer counterfactual matching opportunities for donations, (4) possible donor perception of diminishing returns on marginal donations, (5) variation driven by fluctuation in amounts from larger donors, (6) former earning-to-give donors moving to direct work, (7) urgent needs for funds expressed by MIRI to donors in previous years, causing a front-loading of donations in those years. The post ends by saying that although the fundraiser raised less than expected, MIRI appreciates the donor support and that they will be able to pursue the majority of their growth plans.');
