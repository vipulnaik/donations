Kuhn also discusses how he has been out of the loop of the latest developments in effective altruism, which is part of the reason his grants for this year are so boring. However, he is happy with recent management changes and increased grantmaking activity from the Effective Altruism Funds, and they are currently his default choice of where to allocate money from his donor-advised fund in 2019, if he does not find a better donation target. Kuhn also discusses some logistical aspects of his donation, such as: need to make some of his 2018 donations in 2019 and use of the donor-advised fund to channel his donation to GiveWell'),

The high-level explanation: "This year I am splitting my donations between the Animal Welfare Fund (animals), Evidence Action (global poverty), and the Longevity Research Institute (anti-aging). I’m taking basically the same approach with all three places I’m donating this year. I am not donating to particular programs that I think are high impact, such as malaria nets or cellular agriculture. Instead, I’m delegating my donation decisions to particular people or organizations. In two cases, I’m betting on a specific person that I have reason to believe is more informed, has better judgment, and is generally capable of making better decisions than me. In a third case, Evidence Action, I’m betting on an organization’s process and epistemics: while I know little about their current charities, I’m impressed by their transparency and commitment to admitting when things they’re trying may not work."'),

ACLU is well-funded, but IRAP has just gotten off the ground with a grant from the Open Philanthropy Project, so donating to that'),
