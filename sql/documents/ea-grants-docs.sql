She details issues with the program she has identified, what she has been working on this year, and ongoing and future work. Issues listed include: (1) lack of consolidated records and communications, (2) lack of clarification about the role of EA Grants in the funding ecosystem, (3) significant delays in payment, (4) lack of post-grant assessment, (5) lack of transparency. She describes her work so far as including: (1) addressing historical issues, (2) grantmaking, (3) grantmaking ecosystem investigation. Finally, she talks of ongoing and future work: (1) working with current grantees: she says supporting current grantees is a priority, regardless of what happens to the program, (2) planning for the program''s future: she is leaning toward recommending that EA Grants not be continued, and providing additional funding/capacity to EA Funds to fulfil the niche that EA Grants currently fills.'),
