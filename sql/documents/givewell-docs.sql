The overall amount of money recommended for allocation is $54.6 million, and the document explains that Open Phil''s calculation that it may make sense to spend down more slowly was the reason for reducing the allocation from last year. It discusses the principles used for allocation: (1) Put significant weight on cost-effectiveness estimates, (2) Consider additional information not explicitly modeled about the organization, (3) Consider additional information not explicitly modeled about the funding gap, (4) Assess funding gaps at the margin, (5) Default to not imposing restrictions on charity spending, (6) Default to funding on a 3-year horizon, and (7) Ensure charities are incentivized to engage with the process. The three charities that get significant grants are Malaria Consortium for its SMC program ($33.9 million), Helen Keller International ($9.7 million), and Sightsavers ($2.7 million). Against Malaria Foundation, The END Fund, and GiveDirectly receive the minimum "incentive grant" amount of $2.5 million that all top charities should receive. The top charity Deworm the World Initiative is not given an incentive grant because it received a previous grant through GiveWell discretionary grant that more than covers the incentive grant amount. 8 standout charities get $100,000 each'),

As in previous years, GiveWell recomemnds that donors donate to GiveWell to regrant to top charities at its discretion, but also provides its current ranked list of top charities to help donors make an informed decision. Its ranked list (from best to worst) is: Malaria Consortium (seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program), Against Malaria Foundation, Helen Keller International (vitamin A suppplementation), charities that treat parasitic worm infections (Evidence Action''s Deworm the World Initiative, Sightsavers, The END Fund), and GiveDirectly. From the perspective of cause areas, the rank is: malaria > vitamin A supplementation > deworming > cash transfers. This is consistent with, and highly influenced by, the cost-effectiveness estimates that GiveWell uses. The post highlights Malaria Consortium as the charity to select for donors who want to give directly to a charity. The post links to a number of more in-depth write-ups explaining the charity ranking, as well as to https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities/2019/open-philanthropy-recommendation which describes the recommendation to Open Philanthropy Project (and indirectly, to Good Ventures) on how to allocate funding to the top charities in 2019'),

GiveWell explains why it still has a high opinion of Evidence Action, but notes three questions derived from these developments: (a) selection of implementing partners, (b) process for hiring and evaluating staff, and (c) financial oversight. GiveWell expects to ask Evidence Action to redirect to Deworm the World Initiative the unused funds donated via GiveWell for No Lean Season.

In particular, it responds to a series of tweets from economist Berk Özler expressing concern over GiveWell for (1) using an unpublished paper as a key study, (2) placing little weight on some papers in its analysis of spillover effects, (3) focusing solely on consumption. While replying to the concerns, the GiveWell blog post also explains some of the broader principles used by GiveWell to determine when to use private information, and what evidence to review and what outcomes to consider'),

The post notes the low cost-per-life-saved-equivalent estimate of $2,292, better than that for Against Malaria Foundation, and discusses concerns about drug resistance. It ends with the following reasons people might be interested in donating to the Malaria Consortium: "(a) You care a lot about saving the lives of children under six. (b) You want to donate to a program that definitely works and is cost-effective, even if it might have other negative impacts. (c) You’re optimistic about making significant progress in eradicating malaria in the next few decades, or about malaria not developing drug resistance."'),

In particular, the results of the Cochrane Collaboration and DEVTA, and the discrepancy between them, is discussed. It concludes with reasons to donate to Helen Keller International: "(a) You want to save the lives of children under 6. (b) You want to donate to something that definitely won’t cause significant harm, even if it might not have an effect. (c) You’re optimistic about GiveWell’s further investigations finding that Helen Keller International is as effective as we thought, not less effective. (d) You think Helen Keller International’s technical assistance is more likely to be effective than GiveWell thinks it is. (e) You’re not too concerned about low rates of vitamin A deficiency or about the uncertainties associated with child mortality rates.'),

The post concludes with reasons for donating to AMF: "(a) You care a lot about the deaths of children under five. (b) You think the deaths of fetuses matter as much as the deaths of children under five. (c) You want a program that is robustly good on a bunch of different axes: it makes people less sick and less likely to die and increases their income.

It first discusses the general case for cash, making the argument that people are often better equipped to know how to spend money for themselves than outsiders are. However, it notes that there are cases where it may be easier for informed outsiders to identify some better opportunities, specifically related to preventative health care (that people generally tend to undervalue). This effect is even greater for populations that are lower in literacy and access to information. The blog post concludes with reasons you might donate to GiveDirectly: "(a) You need a lot of warmfuzzies in order to motivate yourself to donate. (b) You think encouraging cash benchmarking is really important, and giving GiveDirectly more money will help that. (c) You want to encourage charities to do more RCTs on their programs by rewarding the charity that does that most enthusiastically. (d) You care about increasing people’s happiness and don’t care about saving the lives of small children, and prefer a certainty of a somewhat good outcome to a small chance of a very good outcome. (e) You believe, in principle, that we should let people make their own decisions about their lives. (f) You want an intervention that definitely has at least a small positive effect.
