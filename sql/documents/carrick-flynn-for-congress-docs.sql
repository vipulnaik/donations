The post talks about personal friendship with Carrick Flynn and the latter''s great track record and promise, as well as some back-of-the-envelope calculations of how much the donation would help the Flynn campaign. The post would be highly influential, leading several people in the comments to announce having donated to the campaign, with at least some of the commenters explicitly citing the post''s influence.'),

He also supports normal Democratic priorities like the environment, abortion rights, and universal health care (see here for longer list). See also this endorsement from biosecurity grantmaker Andrew SB. Although he’s getting support from some big funders, campaign finance privileges small-to-medium-sized donations from ordinary people. If you want to support him, you can see a list of possible options here - including donations. You can donate max $2900 for the primary, plus another $2900 for the general that will be refunded if he doesn’t make it. If you do donate, it would be extra helpful if the money came in before a key reporting deadline March 31."'),

This blog post, written shortly after the results, talks about the uncertainties and the need for better reasoning around not just the benefits of success but the probability of achieving it. It concludes: "I happen to think that donating to Carrick''s campaign was totally reasonable, as an effective intervention, but I fear that the community''s decision-making process wasn''t very grounded in donations'' probability of tipping the election, so I''m concerned that future causes might get support despite being predictably ineffective. Anyway, I''m excited to see Carrick''s future research and policy work."'),

The campaign failed in the primary despite significant enthusiasm and financial support from effective altruists. The lessons listed are: (1) EAs can seriously compete for open congressional seats, and preparing to run well in advance of a race probably would significantly further improve the odds of winning (2) When running for Congress, having political experience and a good track record is very valuable – including if your campaign is backed up with lots of Super PAC donations (3) In Congressional races, more recent ties to the district/state matter much more than ties from long ago (4) If you think you might run for office in the future, make sure to vote in every election (5)  EA candidates themselves may face bad press when running for office, as may the candidates’ large donors, but this doesn’t automatically translate into bad PR for EA as a community (6) As a Democratic candidate, being “the crypto guy” is a political liability; being tied to EA, not as much (7) Even among EAs, politics might somewhat degrade our typical epistemics and rigor – we should guard against this.'),

The campaign failed in the primary despite significant enthusiasm and financial support from effective altruists. The blog post argues that there are still several opportunities for passing pandemic prevention policy. Three concrete ideas are: (1) Set up a group dedicated to lobbying for pandemic prevention legislation. (2) Invest in local candidates running for state/local races. (3) Help other congressional candidates running in open seats who make pandemic prevention a priority, like activist Maxwell Frost, who Protect Our Future is now supporting.'),

This blog post, written two months after that happened, is critical of the idea of EA trying to exercise direct political power (with the Carrick Flynn campaign being an example). The post makes a few points: (1) The arguments on the EA Forum in favor of Flynn’s election were wrong (2) There''s not much overlap between what EA focuses on, and what American politics focuses on (3) American parties are coalitions, and face opposition (4) Pulling the rope sideways -- "EA’s central political advantage is that there is no existing anti-EA movement or public opposition. [...] This strongly suggests that influencing current elected officials, rather than attempting to directly hold political power, plays more towards our strengths."');

It also talks of the connection with Sam Bankman-Fried, a crypto billionaire who is also into effective altruism, and discusses claims that Sam Bankman-Fried is funding the Flynn campaign to push a pro-crypto agenda. The article also describes the "secret Congress theory" -- a theory that the best way to pass legislation supporting one''s cause is to be really focused on it but not very public about it, and try to push for its inclusion in larger bills.');
