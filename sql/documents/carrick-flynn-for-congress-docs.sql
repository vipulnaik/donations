The post talks about personal friendship with Carrick Flynn and the latter''s great track record and promise, as well as some back-of-the-envelope calculations of how much the donation would help the Flynn campaign. The post would be highly influential, leading several people in the comments to announce having donated to the campaign, with at least some of the commenters explicitly citing the post''s influence.'),

He also supports normal Democratic priorities like the environment, abortion rights, and universal health care (see here for longer list). See also this endorsement from biosecurity grantmaker Andrew SB. Although he’s getting support from some big funders, campaign finance privileges small-to-medium-sized donations from ordinary people. If you want to support him, you can see a list of possible options here - including donations. You can donate max $2900 for the primary, plus another $2900 for the general that will be refunded if he doesn’t make it. If you do donate, it would be extra helpful if the money came in before a key reporting deadline March 31."'),

The campaign failed in the primary despite significant enthusiasm and financial support from effective altruists. The lessons listed are: (1) EAs can seriously compete for open congressional seats, and preparing to run well in advance of a race probably would significantly further improve the odds of winning (2) When running for Congress, having political experience and a good track record is very valuable – including if your campaign is backed up with lots of Super PAC donations (3) In Congressional races, more recent ties to the district/state matter much more than ties from long ago (4) If you think you might run for office in the future, make sure to vote in every election (5)  EA candidates themselves may face bad press when running for office, as may the candidates’ large donors, but this doesn’t automatically translate into bad PR for EA as a community (6) As a Democratic candidate, being “the crypto guy” is a political liability; being tied to EA, not as much (7) Even among EAs, politics might somewhat degrade our typical epistemics and rigor – we should guard against this.'),

The campaign failed in the primary despite significant enthusiasm and financial support from effective altruists. The blog post argues that there are still several opportunities for passing pandemic prevention policy. Three concrete ideas are: (1) Set up a group dedicated to lobbying for pandemic prevention legislation. (2) Invest in local candidates running for state/local races. (3) Help other congressional candidates running in open seats who make pandemic prevention a priority, like activist Maxwell Frost, who Protect Our Future is now supporting.'),
