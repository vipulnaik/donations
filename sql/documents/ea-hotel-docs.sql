(2) Funding the EA Hotel is a better way to fill this chasm than trying to directly fund individuals. Some of the good things listed about the hotel: no rent, cheap cost of living and low standard of living, propinquity and collaboration, superconnecting and status building. (3) The EA Hotel is an effective incubator. Some of the good things listed: correct acceptance standards (bar not too high), removing trivial inconveniences, a productivity culture, a growth culture, a support culture, and consistent improvement. Goldenberg, who has previously lived in the group houses Event Horizon and Milivia House, and cofounded Gentle Mesa, compares the environment of the EA Hotel favorably to them.

Of the EA Hotel / CEEALAR, he says: "one of the things I really appreciated about it from my fortnight stay there was that it provided a space for EA-aligned folks to work on things without the pressure to produce legible results. This to me seems extremely valuable because I believe many types of impact are quantized such that no impact is legible until a lot of things fall into place and you get a "windfall" of impact all at once and that there is also a large amount of illegible, "dark" impact being made in EA that goes largely unacknowledged but without which EA would not be as successful."'),
