  ('Andrew Snyder-Beattie','Carrick Flynn for Congress',5800,NULL,'2022-02-05','day','date of donation announcement','Biosecurity and pandemic preparedness','https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qi9nnrmjwNbBqWbNT/the-best-usd5-800-i-ve-ever-donated-to-pandemic-prevention',
  /* donor_donee_reason */ 'The blog post describing the donation gives several reasons: (1) personal friendship with Carrick and high opinion of Carrick''s accomplishments, determination, and work ethic, (2) Flynn''s focus on pandemic prevention and the importance of having somebody in the United States Congress with a focus on pandemic prevention, and (3) the limit of $2,900 on individual donors to political campaigns (counterd separately for the primary and the general election, leading to an effective limit of $5,800 per donor) means that the funding gap for the campaign cannot be filled in by a few wealthy donors, and the value of more people donating is high. The post also includes a crude cost-effectiveness analysis.',
  /* donor_amount_reason */ 'The blog post says: "This campaign provides a rare opportunity for smaller donors to make a large impact, since political contributions are capped at $5,800 per person ($2,900 for the primary and $2,900 for the general, but you can donate both up front)."',
  /* donor_timing_reason */ 'The timing is determined by the timing of https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/ (the political campaign).',
  /* notes */ 'The post has a number of comments, including some voicing concern. Jeff Kaufman and Julia Wise make a donation a few days after the post; see https://www.jefftk.com/donations#footnote2 for details.');
