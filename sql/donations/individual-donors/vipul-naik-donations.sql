It says: "If I were to donate to FMP in the future, or to recommend to others to donate more to it, one thing I''d like to nail down is a better picture of how exactly FMP is spreading the idea of free migration and open borders, and how successful it has been. I might have further conversations with Dave on this point in the coming weeks and months, and might write more about this (even if I don''t make a further donation, as long as I think there''s enough value in what FMP is doing to be worth bringing to the attention of others)."',
