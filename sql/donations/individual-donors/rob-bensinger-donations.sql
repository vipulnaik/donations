He''s a former FHI researcher, I know him via x-risk work. It''s sufficient for me to support him that, e.g., he once gave the best EA Global talk I''ve ever seen on the general idea of astronomical stakes and x-risk."',

Many other donors would simultaneously donate $2900 to the general campaign, but this donation seems limited to the primary campaign.',
