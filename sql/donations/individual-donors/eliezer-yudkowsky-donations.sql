  /* donor_donee_reason */ 'The tweet announcing the donation says that Carrick Flynn "previously worked with Nick Bostrom, on the recommendation of Carl Shulman among others." It links to https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-217 that talks about the reasons many effective altruists are excited to support Flynn''s campaign.',

  /* donor_timing_reason */ 'The timing is determined by the timing of https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/ (the political campaign). https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-217 also says: "If you do donate, it would be extra helpful if the money came in before a key reporting deadline March 31."',
  /* notes */ 'It is likely that $2,900 of the $5,800 would be returned due to Carrick Flynn not winning the primary.');
