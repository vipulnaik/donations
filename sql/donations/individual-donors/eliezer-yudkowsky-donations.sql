  /* donor_donee_reason */ 'The tweet announcing the donation says: "Donated $2900 to the campaign of Carrick Flynn, a Congressional candidate who previously worked with Nick Bostrom, on the recommendation of Carl Shulman among others." It links to https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-217 that talks about the reasons many effective altruists are excited to support Flynn''s campaign.',
  /* donor_amount_reason */ 'Donations to United States political campaigns are limited to $2,900 per donor per campaign. This donation hits the limit and applies to the primary campaign. Many other donors would simultaneously donate $2,900 to the general campaign, but this donation seems limited to the primary campaign.',
  /* donor_timing_reason */ 'The timing is determined by the timing of https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/ (the political campaign). https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/open-thread-217 also says: "If you do donate, it would be extra helpful if the money came in before a key reporting deadline March 31."',
  /* donor_retrospective */ 'Yudkowsky would continue advocating for donating to the campaign; see for instance the tweet https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1523780262718361605 (2022-05-09) that would be cited by Rob Bensinger for a $2,900 donation https://twitter.com/robbensinger/status/1523802187939287042 made shortly afterward.',
