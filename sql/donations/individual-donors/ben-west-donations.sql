  /* donor_donee_reason */ 'The announcement of the donation by Ben West is on Andrew Snyder-Beattie''s post https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qi9nnrmjwNbBqWbNT/the-best-usd5-800-i-ve-ever-donated-to-pandemic-prevention advocating that people donate to the cause. The comment says: "I also donated $5,800. Thanks Andrew for making this post â€“ this seems like a somewhat rare opportunity for <$10k donations to be unusually impactful." This suggests that West was influenced by some of the reasons articulated in the post.',

  /* donor_timing_reason */ 'The timing is determined by the timing of https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/ (the political campaign). The comment announcing the donation happens shortly before the post https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qi9nnrmjwNbBqWbNT/the-best-usd5-800-i-ve-ever-donated-to-pandemic-prevention is published.',
