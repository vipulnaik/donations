  /* donor_donee_reason */ 'The blog post announcing the donation says: "As cheap as it is to save lives in Africa, I see improving U.S. education as the most difficult and important problem of all. This country is rolling in it. It should be a utopia, for crying out loud, and it isn’t close. Poorer countries are eventually going to be this wealthy, but unless we figure out how to promote true equality of opportunity, that wealth isn’t going to translate into what it should. And New Visions has the most promising approach I’ve seen in this area: go straight at the public schools (eliminating the selection bias of charters), and go at them with extreme systematicity and rigor. Read the review for details."',
  /* donor_amount_reason */ 'The donor explains the large amount of the donation, as well as its largeness as a share of his total donation amount, as follows: "I think it’s crazy to make 10 small donations when you could make 1-2 big ones. None of your small donations will solve the problems they’re attacking (i.e., there will still be plenty of the problem left), so why not spend all the money on the most important one? Plus, big donations get you attention: they give you the opportunity to tell a nonprofit what you do and don’t like, and have them listen. The most important reason to concentrate your giving, though, is exactly the reason that most people don’t want to: it forces you to make hard decisions. And that forces you to raise the stakes, learn more, and think harder."',
