  /* donor_donee_reason */ 'The comment announcing the donation says: "I was persuaded by the fact that small dollar donations are particularly useful in elections, which have individual donation caps. Also, if you''re primarily interested in funding longtermist projects, I don''t think there''s much need for small dollar donors in other domains given how much big donors are focusing on LT. I think Carrick has at least a 20% chance based on conversations with relevant domain experts. He''s leading in fundraising, which I expect to continue. Fundraising is more important to electoral success the more obscure the race is, and house primaries are the most obscure federal elections there are. He also got ~10k Twitter followers in a few days and has 10x more than Salinas (his top competitor IMO). I know Twitter isn''t real life, but it speaks to a strong network and savvy comms, which matter a lot in campaigning."',
  /* donor_amount_reason */ 'Donations to United States political campaigns are limited to $2,900 per donor per campaign. This donation hits the limit and applies to the primary campaign. Many other donors would simultaneously donate $2,900 to the general campaign, but this donation seems limited to the primary campaign.',
  /* donor_timing_reason */ 'The timing is determined by the timing of https://www.carrickflynnfororegon.com/ (the political campaign). Regarding a possible conflict of interest, the comment announcing the donation says: "Disclosure: my partner is working on Carrick''s campaign. But I also chose to donate $2900 before she was involved with the campaign."',
