Although the grantee is working on drug policy, the current criminalization of various drugs also makes the grant fall under criminal justice reform. Open Phil hopes to move the United States toward a Portugal-style public health approach to drugs, and sees the grant as a step in that direction.

It is accompanied by a grant from Luke Ding of $51,250 (so the two grants are in a 3:1 ratio) also influenced by GiveWell. As of the time of entering this, the grant from the Open Philanthropy Project is not listed in the Open Philanthropy Project grants database. Also, the GiveWell page on the grant does not explicitly name either donor. The two grants together are expected to cover two years of costs, including budget for a COO (which they succeeded in doing: Evan McVail joined as COO for a year) and a CEO in 2019','GiveWell');
